An open source app project to help you choose the next board game to take out of your collection. No more spending 30 minutes debating—let the app choose for you!

## Description

This application allows a user to catalog their personal board game collection. During a game night, simply enter a few criteria (number of players, available time, type of game, etc.) and the app will filter your collection and suggest a list of compatible games.

This project is actively developed. Feel free to suggest ideas or report bugs!
