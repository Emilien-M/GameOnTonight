## Global Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture with the following layers:
- **Domain**: Entities and interfaces (IRepository, IService)
- **Application**: Business logic with CQRS and Mediator
- **Infrastructure**: Concrete implementations (repositories, services)
- **API**: REST entry points
- **Blazor App**: User interface orient√© Mobile

## Backend Guidelines

### Patterns and Principles (Backend)

#### 1. Repository Pattern
- Use the Repository pattern for data access
- Define interfaces in Domain and implement them in Infrastructure
- Each entity has its specific repository
- Repositories inherit from a generic base class Repository<TEntity>
- Repositories should not contain complex business logic

#### 2. Unit of Work Pattern
- Use a UnitOfWork middleware to automatically apply changes at the end of each HTTP request
- The UnitOfWork is responsible for coordinating transactions between repositories

#### 3. CQRS with Mediator
- Separate read operations (Queries) and write operations (Commands)
- Use the Mediator library for dispatching commands and queries
- Structure the code as follows:
  - Requests are C# records
  - Handlers are defined in the same file as the corresponding request
  - Commands generally return an ID or a boolean
  - Queries return ViewModels (never direct entities)

#### 4. User-based Security
- All business entities implement the IUserOwnedEntity interface
- Each entity belongs to a specific user via the UserId property
- Data access is filtered by user
- Use the CurrentUserService to retrieve the authenticated user

#### 5. Common Properties
- All entities inherit from BaseEntity which provides:
  - Id (int)
  - CreatedAt (DateTime)
  - UpdatedAt (DateTime?)
- CreatedAt and UpdatedAt properties are automatically managed by AuditableEntityInterceptor

#### 6. ViewModels and Input/Output Management
- Never directly expose entities in the API
- Use ViewModels (records) for API endpoint responses
- API controllers take Commands and Queries directly as input models
- Define these objects as C# records
- ViewModels should contain only the properties necessary for display
- ViewModels should include a constructor that takes the corresponding entity as a parameter and performs the mapping automatically

#### 7. Validation
- Input validation is done in Mediator handlers
- Verify authorizations and access rights in handlers
- Return appropriate exceptions in case of error
- Domain entities should validate their own business rules by using DomainError pattern

### Error Handling

#### 1. Global Error Handling
- All exceptions are caught by the `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` and transformed into standardized API responses
- Never handle exceptions manually in controllers, let the middleware handle them
- API responses follow a consistent error format using the `ErrorResponse` model

#### 2. Domain Validation
- Domain entities inherit from `BaseEntity` which provides error collection capabilities
- Entities validate their own state by adding domain errors via `AddDomainError` methods
- Use provided helper methods like `ValidateString` and `ValidateNumber` for common validations
- Complex validations involving multiple properties should be defined in dedicated validation methods
- Always validate domain invariants in setters or business method calls

#### 3. Domain Errors and Exceptions
- `DomainError`: Value object representing a business rule violation, stored in entities
- `DomainException`: Exception containing one or more DomainErrors, thrown at transaction boundaries
- Domain errors are caught and converted to HTTP 400 Bad Request responses
- Other exceptions are treated as HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors by default

#### 4. Error Persistance Prevention
- The UnitOfWork checks all tracked entities for domain errors before saving to database
- If domain errors are detected, a `DomainException` is thrown and changes are not persisted
- This ensures that invalid entities are never stored in the database

#### 5. Error Response Format
```json
{
  "type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1",
  "title": "Validation Error Title",
  "status": 400,
  "traceId": "c7a27145-8352-4267-9238-b3148ce41e32",
  "errors": {
    "propertyName1": ["Error message 1", "Error message 2"],
    "propertyName2": ["Error message 3"]
  }
}
```

### File and Folder Structure (Backend)

#### For Entities
```
GameOnTonight.Domain/
  Entities/
    BaseEntity.cs
    UserOwnedEntity.cs
    [EntityName].cs
```

#### For Repositories
```
GameOnTonight.Domain/
  Repositories/
    IRepository.cs
    I[EntityName]Repository.cs

GameOnTonight.Infrastructure/
  Repositories/
    Repository.cs
    [EntityName]Repository.cs
```

#### For Application Layer (CQRS)
```
GameOnTonight.Application/
  [EntityName]s/
    ViewModels/
      [EntityName]ViewModel.cs
    Commands/
      Create[EntityName]Command.cs
      Update[EntityName]Command.cs
      Delete[EntityName]Command.cs
    Queries/
      Get[EntityName]ByIdQuery.cs
      GetAll[EntityName]sQuery.cs
      [OtherSpecificRequests]Query.cs
```

#### For API
```
GameOnTonight.Api/
  Controllers/
    [EntityName]sController.cs
```

### Naming Conventions (Backend)
- Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, properties, and methods
- Use camelCase for local variables and parameters
- Prefix interfaces with "I"
- Suffix repository classes with "Repository"
- Suffix commands with "Command"
- Suffix queries with "Query"
- Suffix handlers with "Handler"
- Suffix ViewModels with "ViewModel"

### Dependency Injection (Backend)
- Register all services in extension methods (DependencyInjection.cs)
- Use scoped lifetime for repositories and services
- Use the [FromServices] attribute for injection in minimal endpoints

### Namespaces (Backend)
- GameOnTonight.Domain.*
- GameOnTonight.Application.*
- GameOnTonight.Infrastructure.*
- GameOnTonight.Api.*

### Code Quality Guidelines

#### 1. SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Limit each class/function to one well-defined task or area of concern
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Design extensible abstractions and avoid modifications to existing, tested code
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Ensure derived types preserve the behavior contracts of base types
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Create focused, minimal interfaces with only the methods a client needs
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Inject dependencies and program to interfaces, not implementations

#### 2. Comments and Documentation
- Add comments only to explain 'why' something is done, not 'what' is being done
- Code should be self-documenting through clear variable names and function signatures
- Use comments only for:
  - Explaining complex algorithms or business logic
  - Documenting non-obvious edge cases or workarounds
  - Providing context for future developers when the solution isn't immediately intuitive
- Avoid redundant comments that merely restate what the code clearly shows

#### 3. General Principles
- Respect the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid code duplication
- Iterate on existing code before writing new functionality
- Check for similar existing functionality and analyze base classes before implementing
- Adopt a fail-fast approach instead of using fallback values or fallback applications
- If configuration does not work, throw exceptions and terminate the program
- Keep files short (fewer than 300 lines)
- When adding logging to classes, focus on logging errors only

### C# Coding Rules

#### 1. Data Structures and Collections
- Do not use Enumerable methods on indexable collections; use the collection directly
- Prefer comparing 'Count' to 0 rather than using 'Any()' for both clarity and performance

#### 2. Object-Oriented Design
- Do not use marker interfaces or base classes
- Make methods static if they don't use class attributes
- Use 'await using' instead of 'using' whenever possible

#### 3. Exception Handling
- Use ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull and similar methods whenever possible
- Either log the exception and handle it, OR rethrow it with contextual information
- Don't combine exception logging and rethrowing without adding context

#### 4. Naming and Methods
- Use "Async" suffix in names of methods that return an awaitable type
- Inherit from ControllerBase instead of Controller for API controllers
- A method should have a maximum of 7 parameters

#### 5. Date and Time
- Always set the "DateTimeKind" when creating new "DateTime" instances

#### 6. Code Quality
- Try to fix Sonar & Roslyn errors and warnings if any
- Do not test private methods using reflection; test functionality through public methods instead

### Code Organization

#### 1. Step-Down Rule
- Write code that follows the step-down rule:
  - Each function should be followed by functions at the next level of abstraction
  - High-level functions appear first, with their implementation details following
  - A reader can read the code from top to bottom, with each function introducing concepts used by those that follow
  - Functions should be organized in descending order of abstraction
  - Ensure clear separation between different levels of abstraction

## Blazor App Guidelines

These rules cover the Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) application located in GameOnTonight.App. They build upon what is already in place in the project and establish best practices to maintain a healthy and consistent codebase.

### 1. General Architecture (Blazor WASM + PWA)
- Project type: Blazor WebAssembly .NET 9 (Sdk Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly).
- PWA mode: service worker enabled and assets manifest declared via ServiceWorkerAssetsManifest (service-worker.js / service-worker.published.js).
- HTTP communication: via HttpClient and the generated GameOnTonight.RestClient project.
- Client storage: Blazored.LocalStorage to persist information (tokens, preferences, lightweight caches).
- Icons: InfiniLore.Lucide (see Design.md for decisions and usage examples).

### 2. Key Dependencies
Present in GameOnTonight.App.csproj and to be used in a standardized way:
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly, Microsoft.Extensions.Http: Blazor WASM base and HttpClient.
- Blazored.LocalStorage: simple typed local key/value persistence.
- InfiniLore.Lucide: Lucide icon pack as Blazor components, without external JS.
- GameOnTonight.RestClient (ProjectReference): generated and typed REST client for the API.

### 3. Folder Structure (App)
Follow this structure to maintain readability:
```
GameOnTonight.App/
  Layout/           # Layouts (.razor), tab bars, nav
  Pages/            # Routable pages (.razor)
  Components/       # Reusable components (.razor)
  Services/         # Application services (state, RestClient wrappers, HTTP handlers)
  wwwroot/          # Static assets (css, fonts, service worker, appsettings*.json)
  wwwroot/lib/      # Local front libraries (e.g. bootstrap) ‚Äì avoid CDNs
  Properties/
```
Notes:
- Create the Components/ folder if missing and move reusable components there to avoid cluttering Pages/.
- Limit file size to < 300 lines; use code-behind (.razor.cs) to separate logic from markup when necessary.

### 4. Naming Conventions (App)
- Components and pages: PascalCase (e.g. Filter.razor, Library.razor, MainLayout.razor).
- Code-behind files: same name with .razor.cs suffix and partial class.
- Component parameters: [Parameter] in PascalCase (e.g. InitialCount).
- Async methods: Async suffix (OnSubmitAsync, LoadDataAsync) and CancellationToken as last parameter.
- Namespaces: GameOnTonight.App.* (e.g. GameOnTonight.App.Pages, GameOnTonight.App.Services).

### 5. Navigation and Routing
- Define routes at page level with @page (e.g. "/", "/filter", "/library", "/history", "/profile").
- Bottom Tab Bar:
  - 4 tabs: Filter, Library, History, Profile (see Design.md).
  - Unimplemented tabs remain visible but disabled.
  - Use Lucide icons (e.g. Name="filter", "library", "history", "user").
- Always provide a consistent page title (<title> tag) via a dedicated component or via HeadOutlet.

### 6. UI/Design System
- Dark theme by default (see Design.md) with defined color palette (Night Blue #14213D, Orange #FCA311, etc.).
- Default typeface: Poppins (or Inter) ‚Äì load from wwwroot, not via CDN if possible.
- Bootstrap: use the local version under wwwroot/lib/bootstrap; no runtime CDN dependencies.
- Lucide icons via InfiniLore.Lucide: they inherit from currentColor; avoid unnecessary CSS overrides.
  - Minimal example: <LucideIcon Name="filter" />
- UI components:
  - Prefer reusable components (primary/secondary buttons, cards, forms).
  - Respect accessibility (A11y): contrasts, aria-label, visible focus.

### 7. Services and DI (Program.cs)
- Register services at startup:
  - Blazored.LocalStorage (AddBlazoredLocalStorage()).
  - HttpClient (base address from configuration, see ¬ß8).
  - Delegating handlers for auth/logging if necessary.
  - Application wrappers around RestClient for UI-side orchestration logic.
- Example registration (indicative):
```csharp
builder.Services.AddBlazoredLocalStorage();
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(apiBaseUrl) });
// Example: builder.Services.AddScoped<JwtAuthorizationMessageHandler>();
// builder.Services.AddHttpClient("Api", c => c.BaseAddress = new Uri(apiBaseUrl))
//       .AddHttpMessageHandler<JwtAuthorizationMessageHandler>();
```

### 8. Configuration (appsettings)
- Files under wwwroot: appsettings.json + appsettings.Development.json (linked via DependentUpon).
- Recommended key: ApiBaseUrl (backend API URL).
- Load configuration at startup (WASM) before building HttpClient.
- Never store secrets in client-side appsettings.*; use secure initialization endpoints if necessary.

### 9. API Access and RestClient
- Use GameOnTonight.RestClient for all HTTP calls to avoid duplication and serialization errors.
- Create thin application services in GameOnTonight.App/Services that:
  - Call the RestClient.
  - Handle data formatting for the view.
  - Centralize UI error handling.
- Do not consume the API directly from pages; go through services.

### 10. Authentication and Local Storage
- Store tokens in LocalStorage via Blazored.LocalStorage with explicit keys (e.g. auth.accessToken, auth.refreshToken).
- Define a DelegatingHandler that adds the Authorization: Bearer {token} header to outgoing requests.
- Renew the token (refresh) centrally in the handler or authentication service.
- In case of auth failure (401/403), redirect to the login page and purge tokens.

### 11. Error Handling and UX
- Map API errors (backend ErrorResponse format) to clear UI messages.
- Display errors close to fields in forms and provide a global summary if necessary.
- Common error logic in an ErrorService; avoid repetitive try/catch in pages.
- Avoid blocking dialogs; prefer non-intrusive banners/toasts.

### 12. State Management
- Favor lightweight state services (e.g. FilterState) injected as Scoped.
- Use CascadingValues only for cross-cutting state (theme, logged-in user) and sparingly.
- Avoid overusing LocalStorage for volatile state; reserve LocalStorage for preferences and tokens.

### 13. Performance and Rendering
- Always use Async variants (OnInitializedAsync, OnAfterRenderAsync) and CancellationToken.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders: use ShouldRender when appropriate and immutable types for parameters.
- Prefer RenderFragment to compose UI and limit duplication.
- Lazy load large datasets if necessary.

### 14. Testing and Quality
- Test via integration/E2E UI tests when relevant; for services, prefer unit tests.
- Don't test private methods; test observable behavior via public components/services.
- Follow Sonar/Roslyn rules when applicable.

### 15. PWA Specifics
- Service worker:
  - Use a "network first" strategy for API calls and "cache first" for static assets.
  - Plan for update flow: detect a new SW version and prompt for reload.
- Offline:
  - Display a dedicated offline page or clear message when network is unavailable.
- Icon/manifest: keep default values until branding is provided (see Design.md).

### 16. Project-Specific UI Rules (Design.md recap)
- Tab Bar: 4 tabs (Filter, Library, History, Profile). Unimplemented tabs: visible but disabled.
- Dark theme by default; Orange #FCA311 accents for primary action.
- Lucide icons: prefer lowercase names ("filter", "library", "history", "user").

### 17. Component/Page Checklist
Before validating a component/page:
- Conforming name and namespace.
- Async methods, cancellation supported.
- API errors handled and user messages present.
- Basic accessibility (labels, aria, focus).
- No CDN dependencies.
- File < 300 lines or code-behind created.

By following these guidelines, implementation will respect the desired architecture and patterns for the GameOnTonight project.
