# Project Roadmap

This document describes the objectives and planned features for future versions of the Board Game Assistant. The roadmap is divided into several phases, starting with the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) up to longer-term ambitions.

> **Note**: This roadmap is a living document. It may evolve based on community feedback and technical challenges encountered.

## ðŸš§ Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
**Status: In progress**

The goal of this phase is to launch a functional, stable, and useful first version of the application, including all basic features.

- [ ] User management: Account creation and authentication.
- [ ] Game library management: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for games in the personal collection.
- [ ] Filtering system: Find a game based on criteria (number of players, time, type, etc.).
- [ ] Simple game history: Basic tracking of played games.
- [ ] Offline mode: View and filter the collection without an internet connection.
- [ ] Installable (PWA): The application can be installed on mobile and desktop for quick access.
- [ ] Finalization of the technical stack: Choice and implementation of the database.
- [ ] Documentation for contributors: Creation and publication of the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

## ðŸš€ Phase 2: Improvements and Social Features
**Status: Planned**

Once the MVP is stable, the focus will be on enriching the user experience and adding a social and practical dimension.

- [ ] Integration of a data API (e.g., BoardGameGeek):
    - Automatic filling of game information (description, illustrator, duration, complexity, etc.) from its name.
    - Automatic retrieval of game cover images.

- [ ] Improved history:
    - Add details to played games: present players, scores, winner, photos, and notes.
    - Statistics on games (e.g., most played game, win rate, most frequent players).

- [ ] Wishlist management: Allow users to save games they would like to acquire.

- [ ] Sharing features:
    - Share your game library via a public link (read-only).
    - Share the result of a filter ("Here are the games we could play tonight!").

## ðŸŒŸ Phase 3: Advanced Features and Community
**Status: Under consideration**

This phase aims to make the application a complete tool for enthusiasts and gaming groups, creating more engagement.

- [ ] Smart suggestions:
    - Algorithm suggesting relevant games based on history, preferences, or games that haven't been played for a long time.

- [ ] Organizing game nights:
    - Create an event.
    - Invite friends (who are also users of the application).
    - Create a poll to choose the game for the evening from a filtered selection of the organizer's library.

- [ ] Expansion management: Link expansions to their base games.

- [ ] Localization (i18n):
    - Translate the interface into several languages, starting with English.

## ðŸ’¡ Future and Long-Term Ideas
**Status: Under consideration**

Ideas and concepts that could be explored if the need arises.

- [ ] Barcode scanning: Add a game to your collection by simply scanning its box.
- [ ] Campaign management: Track progress in scenario-based games (legacy, etc.).
- [ ] Customizable themes for the interface.
- [ ] Management of multiple or shared libraries (for board game associations).
